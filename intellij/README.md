# PyCharm/IntelliJ Idea

Since Visual Studio Code is my primary editor, I want the same keybindings when I have to spin up PyCharm for a large codebase. There is no built-in VS Code keymap in PyCharm so I adapted Sublime keymap into this.

## Installation
### Linux
Copy `vscode.xml` to `~/.PyCharm<yyyy.x>/config/keymaps`.

### Windows
Copy `vscode.xml` to `C:\Users\<username>\.PyCharm<yyyy.x>\config\keymaps`.
